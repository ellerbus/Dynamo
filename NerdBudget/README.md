# Dynamo's Nerd Budget

Dynamo is a friendly generator that uses [DB Schema Reader](http://dbschemareader.codeplex.com/)
and [DotLiquid Syntax](https://github.com/formosatek/dotliquid) to generate code files.

*Nerd Budget* is a sample project using Dynamo's templates as a basis for project development.

*Why doesn't the code generated by the templates perfectly match _Nerd Budget's_ API?*
Templates are a basis to jump start project development, not a 100% solution for taking
requirements to UAT and project completion. Once the code is generated, it is up to the
development team to the implement logic to meet business requirements for the final
deliverables.
